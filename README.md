Full Stack PERN Todo List Application made with
- React JS
- Node JS
- Express JS
- Bootstrap
- PostgreSQL

Note: While I could've used axios to make all the requests easier, I wanted to refresh on normal fetch requests, hence why I used them isntead of requiring axios

Things Learned/Refreshed on:
- Cross origin requests (cors)
- pool.query --> querying to a postgreSQL database
- SQL queries (SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT etc.)
- psql commands from the terminal (setting up the config file path was a good refresher on bash as well)

NOTE: This app has not been deployed yet, I will deploy it soon
